@inproceedings{EnergyReductionCompilerOptions,
abstract = {This paper presents a statistical approach of finding a set of optimum compiler options to minimize the energy consumption of the compiled executable. The method employs a statistical, non-parametric analysis, namely the Mann-Whitney test, to determine a set of options to be turned on and off for a particular source code. Energy measurements show that an improvement of up to 15\% over the default optimization set up of the compiler can be achieved with this methodology.},

@inproceedings{Haneda2005,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose a statistical method to determine the setting of compiler options. Conventionally, programmers use standard - Ox settings which are provided by compiler developers. However, in order to obtain maximal performance, it is necessary to tune the compiler setting for the application as well as the underlying architecture. In this paper, we propose a methodology to configure compiler options automatically using profile information. We apply non-parametric statistical analysis, in particular the Mann-Whitney test, to decide whether to turn on or to turn off compiler flags. This approach produces compiler settings of gcc 33.1 for the SPEC2000 benchmark suite that outperform the standard - Ox switches on a Pentium 4 processor.},
